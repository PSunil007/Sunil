<p>Scan and Print Capabilities The major function of Scan and Print is to provide a quick and easy way to scan and print documents that need little to no modification. Various job ticket options and document enhancements are available, as well as the capability to save scanned pages as RDO or PDF files for later printing. Interface Design The layout of the Scan and Print interface is designed so that when a setting is selected that effects other settings below and to the right of it, the change is cascaded to those lower settings. For example, if the Color mode setting is selected, the Deskew and Despeckle settings are automatically grayed out, since color images cannot be deskewed or despeckled. This feature makes entering scan and print settings fast and easy. Status Bar The top of the Scan and Print interface has a status bar that provides application updates to the user. The first line of text provides scanning status information. The second line indicates the number of pages scanned. The third line provides printing status and other informational messages. Advanced Options Advanced scanning options are available through the installed scanner interface (either Xerox or ScanTool). Advanced printing options are available through the Production Printer Job Setup dialog. When an option is selected in one of the advanced interface screens (scanner or printer), the information is mapped one-to-one to the Scan and Print interface. For example, if you change the number of print copies on the Job Setup dialog, then that change is reflected in the Scan and Print interface.
